Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

What is average value?
Max value?
